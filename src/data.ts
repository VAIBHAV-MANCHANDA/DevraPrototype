    description: "Featured on Buildofy, Sansarg is a celebration of interconnected spaces, deep courtyards, and honest material usage. Designed as a sanctuary for a multi-generational family, the residence plays with double-height volumes and the gentle movement of natural light throughout the day.",
    narrative: {
      site: "The site is located in a quiet residential pocket of Patiala, experiencing hot summers and cold winters. Privacy from neighboring plots was a primary constraint, which led to an introverted, courtyard-centric design.",
      planning: "Planned as a split-level home, Sansarg is organized around a central double-height courtyard. This courtyard acts as the lungs of the house, drawing in cool air and dispersing soft daylight into the deep living spaces. Ground floor spaces merge seamlessly with the outdoor lawns, while private bedrooms are placed on the upper floor with direct access to terrace gardens.",
      materials: "The material palette is limited and tactile: exposed board-marked concrete, natural local sandstone, teak wood, and black slate. There are no applied finishes like paint on the structural surfaces, allowing the organic textures to breathe and age beautifully.",
      lightVentilation: "Passive solar principles guide the openings. Deep cantilevers protect the south-facing glazing from the harsh summer sun, while high ventilators at the top of the courtyard create a stack effect, continuously flushing out hot air to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature naturally.",
      execution: "Special care was given to the concrete casting. The shuttering patterns were carefully coordinated with local artisans, resulting in a textured, rhythmic surface that changes character as the sun shifts."

      planning: "The layout breaks away from the conventional closed room-by-room format. Instead, the kitchen, dining, and living rooms form an open visual pavilion on the ground floor, separated only by light wooden louvers. This open-concept design promotes family interaction and visual openness.",

    summary: "Indian homes have specific cultural requirements—from ritual-first puja rooms, heavy spice-oriented wet kitchens, and high numbers of family guests. Here's how we plan for real life.",
    author: "Ar. Rajkumar Devra",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    content: "When designing homes in Chandigarh, Punjab, and broader India, we often see clients requesting open-concept plans seen in Western design magazines. While visually stunning, a purely open plan often collides with the daily realities of Indian cooking, joint-family dynamics, and hosting habits.\n\n### 1. The Necessity of the Double Kitchen\nIndian cooking is robust, involving spices, frying, and intense heat. An open kitchen directly facing a formal living room often leads to oil residues settling on expensive upholstery and food aromas dispersing across the house. We solve this by planning a 'Dual Kitchen' system: a clean, aesthetic outer kitchen for light prep, brewing tea, and family breakfasts, paired with a fully ventilated, closed 'Wet Kitchen' or pantry where heavy cooking and cleaning occur.\n\n### 2. Privacy vs. Family Interconnection\nJoint families or families with visiting parents require a fine balance between communal gathering and personal privacy. We design homes with 'split zoning.' Public spaces like formal drawing rooms are kept near the main entrance to shelter the inner family circle. The family lounge, dining space, and central courtyard are grouped at the core, while bedrooms are treated as distinct, private pods.\n\n### 3. Adapting to Festivals & Social Gatherings\nOur homes must adapt dynamically. A quiet house of four must comfortably expand to host forty guests during festivals, dinners, or rituals. This requires flexible spaces—sliding partition doors, wide verandahs that open to double the living room's footprint, and modular courtyard layouts that serve as active social gathering zones."

    summary: "How carefully calculated sun angles, brick cavity walls, double-height central courtyards, and deep cantilevers keep homes cool during blazing 45°C Chandigarh summers.",
    author: "Ar. Rajkumar Devra",
    readTime: "8 min read",
    content: "With global temperatures rising, relying entirely on heavy air conditioning is neither environmentally responsible nor financially smart. True luxury lies in designing homes that remain naturally cool and well-insulated, utilizing passive climate-responsive strategies.\n\n### 1. The Double Wall (Thermal Mass)\nHeat enters a building primarily through its walls and roof. By building double-layered brick masonry with a 2-inch hollow air cavity in between, we create a powerful thermal barrier. The outer brick layer absorbs the direct solar heat, while the air cavity prevents the heat from transferring to the inner wall, keeping the indoor surfaces cool even when the outdoor temperature hits 45°C.\n\n### 2. Double-Height Courtyards as Vent Scoops\nNatural air circulation is driven by physics. Hot air rises. By planning a double-height space or central courtyard with high, operable louvers (ventilators) near the roof, we create a continuous chimney effect. Warm air naturally exits through the top, pulling cooler air in from shaded ground-level garden margins and water bodies, creating a gentle, organic air draft.\n\n### 3. The Power of Deep Cantilevers\nWe design deep concrete projections and shaded balcony decks specifically on the south and west facades. During the summer, when the sun is high in the sky, these cantilevers completely shade the glass windows. In the winter, when the sun is lower, the sunlight penetrates deep into the rooms, providing natural, comforting warmth."

    content: "In our projects, we avoid artificial finishes, plastic composite claddings, and excessive paint. We prefer materials that are genuine, natural, and express their real weight and texture. Here is how we evaluate materials for residential architecture:\n\n### 1. Stone: Kota and Sandstone vs. Polished Marble\nWhile polished Italian marble is exceptional for interior living rooms, it can be highly slippery and prone to weathering if used on exterior porches or courtyard decks. For transition spaces, we prefer Kota stone (available in blue and green hues) with a leathered or river-washed finish. It is highly durable, non-slip, feels cool under bare feet, and develops a rich natural patina over time. For facades, we use regional Dholpur or Agra sandstones, which resist monsoon stains and sun bleaching.\n\n### 2. Shuttering Concrete as a Finish\nExposed concrete is often misunderstood as cold or industrial. However, when cast against planned wooden timber planks (board-marked concrete), the concrete permanently registers the organic grain and knots of the wood. The result is a highly tactile, stone-like wall that requires zero paint, zero scrubbing, and acts as a beautiful, neutral background for indoor art and plants.\n\n### 3. Seasoned Teak vs. Veneers\nFor doors and window frames exposed to weather, we always prioritize seasoned CP Teak or Burma Teak. It has a high natural oil content that prevents warping, swelling, and termite damage during the humid monsoons, far outlasting manufactured MDF or thin veneers."

    content: "When people enter a luxury space that feels calm and relaxing, they often credit the furniture or the marble. In reality, the quiet hero is almost always the lighting. Poorly planned lighting—like placing a grid of powerful white LED downlights directly overhead—creates harsh shadows, eye fatigue, and ruins the natural texture of materials.\n\n### 1. Indirect Lighting First\nWe believe in concealing light sources. By placing high-quality warm LED strips inside plaster coves or behind wall wood panels, the light bounces off the ceilings and walls before reaching your eyes. This diffused, indirect light mimics the soft, ambient glow of dusk, immediately signaling the nervous system to relax.\n\n### 2. Layering: Ambient, Task, and Accent\nAn editorial room has depth. We achieve this by layering lights at different heights. Low floor lamps and table lamps establish a cozy ambient level. Recessed task lighting is focused precisely where needed, such as over kitchen counters or reading chairs. Accent lighting—like micro-spots with specialized honeycombed grids—is used to highlight artwork or stone textures without spilling light onto the surrounding walls.\n\n### 3. The 2700K Warmth Standard\nIn residential design, we strictly use light sources between 2700K and 3000K (warm white). Warm light brings out the natural red, orange, and yellow undertones of wood, copper, and stone, making a house feel secure, intimate, and deeply welcoming in the evening."
